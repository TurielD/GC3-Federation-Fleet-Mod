# GC3-Federation-Fleet-Mod


As of 8-6-2015 the mod consists of 20 ship templates and one mod installation folder, both stored on ModDB at: http://www.moddb.com/mods/starfleet-mod 



As its description states: "This is (an early version of) a ShipStyle mod for GalCiv 3 - that is, it adds a new custom set of ships and templates which you can use in place of any of the standard races. It currently features 20 ship models that will take you from Tiny exploration ships all the way through to Huge warships. These template ships can be used with or without the StyleSet modification."


**Aknowledgements**:
Federation faction images contributed by 00zim00, who has a whole set of Star Trek images available here:
